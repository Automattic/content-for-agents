# Plugin guide

This guide describes the public behavior and extension contracts of Content for
Agents. For installation, see the [README](../README.md). For development
setup and checks, see the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The plugin requires WordPress 7.0 or newer and PHP 8.2 or newer. On an
unsupported runtime, it registers no hooks and shows an administrator notice.
Markdown responses send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Applications that
render the Markdown as HTML must sanitize the result: posts and integration
callbacks can supply content.

## Content and discovery

### URLs and access

For a published post at `/example/`, the canonical Markdown URL is
`/example/markdown`, with an optional trailing slash. With plain permalinks,
it is `?p=123&markdown=true`. Discovery links use the appropriate form. The
static front page uses `/?markdown=true`; `/markdown` remains available as a
normal page. Its old slug does not provide a hidden Markdown path.

Unprotected published posts are public. For other statuses, WordPress must
resolve a singular post and grant the visitor read permission.
WordPress validates preview revisions and nonces before the plugin serves
them; an authenticated `?p=ID` request may also resolve a readable draft.
The plugin does not look up unresolved drafts, pending posts, scheduled posts,
or custom statuses by ID. Trash, auto-drafts, revisions, and other internal
statuses are never served. Password-protected content requires the password
or edit permission as well as read permission. Authenticated and
password-authorized responses do not enter the shared cache.

Markdown paths use VIP's cached URL lookup first. If it misses a nested page,
WordPress's page-path lookup is used only when that page's permalink exactly
matches the requested path. The access check still applies. Local development
uses WordPress core URL lookup when VIP's API is unavailable.

Third-party paywall and access-control integrations must veto Markdown access
when the current visitor is not entitled to read a post. They must also disable
shared caching whenever entitlement depends on visitor-specific state such as a
cookie:

```php
add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_can_serve_markdown',
	static function ( bool $allowed, \WP_Post $post, string $context ): bool {
		if ( ! example_is_gated( $post ) ) {
			return $allowed;
		}

		return 'discovery' !== $context && example_current_visitor_can_read( $post );
	},
	10,
	3
);

add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_can_cache_markdown',
	static function ( bool $cacheable, \WP_Post $post ): bool {
		return $cacheable && ! example_is_gated( $post );
	},
	10,
	2
);
```

These filters can restrict access and caching, but cannot grant access that
WordPress denies. Integrations must invalidate cached Markdown when their
access rules change.

### Conversion

See the [conversion architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the order of block
callbacks, HTML fallback, and response assembly.

Output contains YAML frontmatter, a default H1 from the WordPress post title,
and converted content. The title remains in frontmatter. The Markdown prefix
filter can change or omit the H1, or add content before the converted body.
Frontmatter descriptions use the WordPress excerpt, then the first
blank-line-delimited Markdown segment. Integrations can replace the description with
`content_for_agents_frontmatter`. Supported published HTML pages advertise
their Markdown URL.

The converter handles quotes, citations, lists, tables, links, images,
strikethrough, and code. Explicit `language-*` classes label fenced code.
Audio, video, iframe sources, and lite YouTube embeds become links. Core embeds
use a readable WordPress preview when available; otherwise their URL remains.
Figures and captions stay inside their list item. Table captions become text
beside the table. WordPress 7.0 accordion headings, math text, and visible
status messages are retained. Interface controls are omitted, except buttons
that label headings.

HTML conversion targets CommonMark with GFM tables and strikethrough. Links
escape Markdown syntax; links inside inline code keep their styling and URLs.
`<br>` becomes a hard break where possible and remains HTML in headings, table
cells, and at formatting or block ends. Inline code containing `<br>` uses HTML
`<code>`. Preformatted code uses fenced blocks. Content marked `hidden` or
`aria-hidden="true"` is excluded. Links without a destination become plain
text. The converter also applies WordPress's same-site HTTP-to-HTTPS replacement.

Classic Editor posts and freeform HTML mixed with blocks use the same HTML
conversion path. Freeform content has no block name, so block-level callbacks
do not run for it. The plugin does not require the Block
Editor to be enabled.

Core post-title and post-excerpt blocks use the current post context.
Registered shortcodes in Shortcode blocks, ordinary rendered blocks, and
Classic Editor content run their callbacks, as they do in HTML. Wrapper-owned
HTML around child blocks follows the same path. Rendered shortcode
output is converted to Markdown; iframe players retain a link to the embedded
media. An unregistered shortcode with a recognizable `url` attribute or
positional URL becomes a link. Bracketed prose and shortcodes without a URL
remain literal. Registered block-level Markdown callbacks take precedence.
Conversion does not run `the_content` over the entire post;
other block render callbacks may still execute code.

Conversion intentionally reads the stored `post_content` and walks its parsed
block tree instead of applying WordPress's `the_content` filter. This preserves
the callback precedence described below and avoids mixing
HTML presentation filters with Markdown authorization. Integrations should use
`content_for_agents_pre_markdown` or `content_for_agents_after_markdown` for
content transformations and `content_for_agents_can_serve_markdown` for access
control. See [Site integrations](INTEGRATIONS.md) for a canonical URL retirement
example.

## Extend the base

All PHP classes live in `Content_For_Agents`. Public hooks, the
Content-Signal option, and cache groups use `content_for_agents` or
`content-for-agents` identifiers.

Register a block callback before `init` priority 5. Block types can be
registered through WordPress independently of the Markdown callback:

```php
add_action( 'content_for_agents_register_block_callbacks', static function () {
    \Content_For_Agents\Block_Markdown_Registry::register(
        'example/quote',
        static function ( array $block, \WP_Post $post ): string {
            return '> ' . sanitize_text_field( $block['attrs']['text'] ?? '' );
        }
    );
} );
```

`content_for_agents_register_block_callbacks` is an action for registering
callbacks, not a filter that converts blocks. During conversion, `get()` returns
the registered callback for a block name, or `null` when none exists. A missing
callback lets the plugin use its built-in handling or rendered-HTML fallback.
Callbacks receive the parsed block and its post and return Markdown. Their
result is authoritative: an empty string suppresses the block, and `null` is
not a fallthrough signal. Registry methods `register()`, `get()`, and `has()`
are public. A later registration for the same block name replaces the earlier
one.

Callback Markdown is authoritative, including list markers and indentation.
Callbacks for list items must return complete Markdown such as `- Item` or
`1. Item`; the converter does not infer or prepend list markers. A parent
callback owns its entire subtree. It can select visible `innerBlocks` and pass
them to `Markdown_Converter::blocks_to_markdown()` to invoke child callbacks;
otherwise those callbacks do not run. Without a parent callback, the converter
walks saved `innerContent` when descendants need their own Markdown strategy,
including a child callback or `core/embed`. Each child callback can return `''`
to hide that child.

Integrations must keep these choices consistent with rendered HTML. If a
parent's WordPress renderer hides or rearranges children, give that parent a
Markdown callback using the same visibility rule. A child callback alone
cannot determine what an unrelated parent renderer will display.

Return `''` from a registered callback to omit a block and its children. To
omit only the wrapper, return
`( new Markdown_Converter() )->blocks_to_markdown( $block['innerBlocks'] ?? array(), $post )`.
Registry output passes through `content_for_agents_block_{block-name}`.

Public hooks:

- `content_for_agents_pre_markdown` receives the post. Return `null` to continue
  conversion, or a string to supply the body.
- `content_for_agents_after_markdown` filters the body when serving a document.
  Direct `post_to_markdown()` calls do not run it.
- `content_for_agents_can_serve_markdown` receives the post and a `response` or
  `discovery` context. Return `false` to deny access; it cannot grant access.
- `content_for_agents_can_cache_markdown` receives the post. Return `false` to
  keep visitor-specific output out of the shared cache. This is checked in
  `Markdown_Access::can_cache()` before `Markdown_Response` reads or writes its
  document cache.
- `content_for_agents_frontmatter` receives the post. Return the metadata array;
  replace its `authors` entry to provide custom bylines.
- `content_for_agents_markdown_prefix` receives the default title H1, the post,
  and the converted Markdown body. Return a Markdown string to place after
  frontmatter and before the body. The body is converted first so the filter can
  inspect it. Multiline output works; include the trailing blank line that
  separates it from the body. Return `''` to omit the prefix.
- `content_for_agents_content_signal_values` receives stored values or defaults.
  `Markdown_Response::get_content_signal_header()` applies it when building
  the Markdown response header and the `robots.txt` directive.
- `content_for_agents_set_context` and `content_for_agents_clear_context` set
  and clear an optional conversion context for external integrations. The base
  plugin does not set one. A block callback can read it with
  `Block_Markdown_Registry::get_context()`. Clear it in `try/finally`.

### Common filter examples

Replace the default author byline with provider-neutral post data and add a
frontmatter field:

```php
add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_frontmatter',
	static function ( array $data, \WP_Post $post ): array {
		$credit = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'article_credit', true );
		if ( is_string( $credit ) && '' !== $credit ) {
			$data['authors'] = array( array( 'name' => $credit ) );
		}
		$data['language'] = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'language', true ) ?: 'en';
		return $data;
	},
	10,
	2
);
```

The Markdown prefix defaults to the post title as an H1. These are independent
examples of changing it:

**Use a custom title** stored in `agent_heading`:

```php
add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_markdown_prefix',
	static function ( string $prefix, \WP_Post $post ): string {
		$title = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'agent_heading', true );
		if ( ! is_string( $title ) || '' === trim( $title ) ) {
			return $prefix;
		}

		$title = ( new \Content_For_Agents\HTML_To_Markdown_Converter() )->convert( $title );
		return "# $title\n\n";
	},
	10,
	2
);
```

**Omit the title**:

```php
add_filter( 'content_for_agents_markdown_prefix', '__return_empty_string' );
```

**Add the WordPress excerpt** below the default title:

```php
add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_markdown_prefix',
	static function ( string $prefix, \WP_Post $post ): string {
		$excerpt = get_the_excerpt( $post );
		if ( '' === trim( $excerpt ) ) {
			return $prefix;
		}

		$excerpt = ( new \Content_For_Agents\HTML_To_Markdown_Converter() )->convert( $excerpt );
		return $prefix . $excerpt . "\n\n";
	},
	10,
	2
);
```

Use `$post->post_excerpt` instead of `get_the_excerpt( $post )` to include only
a manually saved excerpt.

See [Site integrations](INTEGRATIONS.md#seo-descriptions-in-frontmatter) for a
Rank Math description example using the frontmatter filter.

The plugin enables WordPress `post` and `page` by default. Other post types,
including custom post types and attachments, need the `content-for-agents`
support flag. Add it after registering the type:

```php
add_action(
	'init',
	static function (): void {
		add_post_type_support( 'book', 'content-for-agents' );
	},
	20
);
```

An integration that owns the post type can instead include
`content-for-agents` in its `register_post_type()` `supports` array.
Provider-specific data, queries, and dependencies remain outside the base plugin.

### Cache invalidation

When related data changes, integrations identify the affected article IDs and call:

```php
\Content_For_Agents\Markdown_Cache_Invalidator::invalidate_post( $article_id );
```

The call clears the article and its parent, and purges their Markdown paths
and query endpoints. Moving a child also clears its former parent. Category,
tag, and author display-name changes clear affected documents in batches of
100; WordPress schedules later batches through VIP Cron Control. VIP queues
and deduplicates URL purges, so edge-cache refresh is not immediate. Call
before permanent deletion if the old permalink must be purged. A callback
that changes output does not automatically invalidate cached content.

## Metadata and Content-Signal contracts

Markdown responses include a `Content-Signal` header. The `robots_txt` filter
adds the same site-wide values to `robots.txt` where the platform permits it.

Frontmatter accepts nested PHP arrays (maps or lists), strings, finite numbers,
booleans, and null, with a maximum nesting depth of 32. Empty arrays render as
empty lists. Objects and resources are unsupported. Mapping keys and strings
are quoted; Unicode and escaped line breaks survive a YAML round trip.

Content-Signal accepts `yes`/`no`, `true`/`false`, booleans, and `1`/`0` for
`ai-train`, `search`, and `ai-input`. Unknown keys and values are omitted. The
default is `yes` for all three signals. The filter receives the option value
before validation and takes precedence over it. Return an empty array to omit
the signal from both outputs. Use a consistent site-wide value so cached
responses and `robots.txt` express the same policy:

```php
add_filter(
	'content_for_agents_content_signal_values',
	static function (): array {
		return array(
			'ai-train' => 'no',
			'search'   => 'yes',
			'ai-input' => 'no',
		);
	}
);
```
